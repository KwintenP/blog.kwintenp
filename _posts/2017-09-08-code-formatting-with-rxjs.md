One of the main benefits of RxJS to me is that it provides code that is 'readable'. It provides use with a declarative programming approach where implementation details are hidden away. We are just describing what needs to be done, not how it should be done. This makes code you look at easy to understand.

One problem that I face reguraly when looking at other peoples code is that the code formatting or the way the RxJS code is written, takes away part of the benefit of writing your code this way. This post is a small summary on how I would love to format my code to keep the readabillity benefits to a maximum.
