Ever since I first started using RxJS up until this very day, it has become my absolute favorite way of coding. I cannot believe to work in a world without observables anymore nor can I understand on how I was able to write code before. I have started sharing the knowlegde I had through blogposts, workshops and coaching. 

One thing that always comes up while working with observables is the very high learning curve. It's really hard to get the concept into your mind when you start with it. One of the reasons for this is that it's really hard to visualize and debug the observables in your application. 
With this in the back of my mind, I started wondering how that could be fixed. If there only was a way to clearly see the data flowing in the streams of your application in realtime. That's how the idea for Rx Devtools was born.
